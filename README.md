# Introduction

National Health Service (NHS) Wales employs several time series forecasting techniques. In order to support the processes for planning and decision-making, both strategically (at All Wales level) and operationally (at local health board level). However, using base forecasting to analyse individual time series and the aggregated level can cause inconsistencies. Therefore, hierarchical time series forecasting method is to be used in this study. 

# Background

The COVID-19 outbreak created unexpected difficulties of the forecasting for the attendance of Emergency Department in NHS-Wales. Therefore, NHS-Wales is seeking a reliable and consistent forecasting model regardless of the shifting patterns of patientsâ€™ arrivals during the lockdowns and health policy changes. 

# Goal

This project's main goal is to create a forecasting models for emergency departments that can consistently deliver outcomes at the individual hospital, each local health board, and national levels. The research will allow for a comparison of:

1. Forecasting national time series and with local time series combined.
2. Forecasting time series hierarchically.

By doing this, I hope to create a system that synchronises policymakers' projections with operational forecasts, guaranteeing an efficient decision-making process.

# Anticipated Results


1. Determine the most reliable and accurate forecasting method for the attendance number for emergency departments in Wales.
2. Provide evidence for why hierarchical time series methods are superior than other forecasting methods.
3. Offer a scalable, transparent method that can be used by other NHS departments.
